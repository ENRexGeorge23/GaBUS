## 📌 About the Project

> *“Revolutionizing the way people experience public transport.”*

GaBus was developed to solve recurring issues in public transit: inconsistent schedules, lack of seat availability, and poor visibility into real-time bus locations. This centralized system allows:

- 🔹 **Passengers** to discover buses, book seats (even while on the road!), pay via a built-in wallet, and track routes live.
- 🔹 **Drivers** to manage their availability, view occupancy in real time, accept walk-in passengers, and monitor their earnings.
- 🔹 **Admins** to register new buses, monitor fleet performance, verify users for discounts, and get full visibility into system-wide earnings.
